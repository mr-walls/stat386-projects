## What is understanding?

A few years back, my dad sat me down to talk career.

"Nate, you can't go into programming," he said.

"What makes you say that?" I replied.

"Automation is going to take away all the jobs in programming."

The _silence_ as I tried to find an explanation took a little while.

"Do you understand who does the automating?"

That conversation is, in a nutshell, why I like to compare data science
to witchcraft. My dad already understood _what_ automation was, and even _why_
we automate. He just overlooked the critical information of _how_.


I will return to this post to flesh out my ideas more fully at a later date.
