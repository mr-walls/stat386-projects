## Quick Recap

To start off this project, I took a look at cards in a game I play, called Yu-Gi-Oh!
The game may have been built for children, but cards can get expensive. So, I decided
to collect a list of every card that had been printed for the game in the last year. I then
scraped price data about those cards when they get sold on dedicated second-hand
websites. Cards tend to have multiple different versions available, so it's possible
to get versions that a little cheaper, but look different.

As I explored the data, I quickly found that the price differences between cards
are super variable. Even the specific rarity of card wasn't always a good indicator
of how pricey it would actually be. To figure out just how much full decks might cost, I decided to simulate buying decks of 70
cards, as that's how many would be in a tournament ready deck.


## The Story

After running this simulation 10,000 times, I wasn't too shocked by the results, but that's only
because I've been playing the game for a while. I've seen a lot of people shell out the extra $2,000+
to make sure they get the most expensive versions of cards available, even when the cheapest version
does the same thing in-game. For context, a recent championship tournament winning deck costed
around $550 for the minimum rarity, which is about par for the course. That means people willingly shell out 5x the money for that
sweet, sweet, shiny cardboard.
